Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt called it the DRY1 principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Kent Beck made it one of the core principles of Extreme Programming and call it: “Once, and only once.” Ron Jeffries ranks this rule second, just below getting all the tests to pass.\nEvery time you see duplication in the code, it represents a missed opportunity for abstraction. That duplication could probably become a subroutine or perhaps another class outright. By folding the duplication into such an abstraction, you increase the vocabulary of the language of your design. Other programmers can use the abstract facilities you create. Coding becomes faster and less error prone because you have raised the abstraction level.\nThe most obvious form of duplication is when you have clumps of identical code that look like some programmers went wild with the mouse, pasting the same code over and over again. These should be replaced with simple methods.\nA more subtle form is the switch/case or if/else chain that appears again and again in various modules, always testing for the same set of conditions. These should be replaced with polymorphism.\nStill more subtle are the modules that have similar algorithms, but that don’t share similar lines of code. This is still duplication and should be addressed by using the Template Method2 or Strategy pattern3.\nIndeed, most of the design patterns that have appeared in the last fifteen years are simply well-known ways to eliminate duplication. So too the Codd Normal Forms are a strategy for eliminating duplication. Not surprisingly, so is structured programming.\nI think the point has been made. Find and eliminate duplication wherever you can."

Sometimes we do this by creating abstract classes to hold the higher level concepts and derivatives to hold the lower level concepts, When we do this, we need to make sure that the separation is complete. We want all the lower level concepts to be in the derivatives and all the higher level concepts to be in the base class.\nFor example, constants, variables, or utility functions that pertain only to the detailed implementation should not be present in the base class.\nThis rule also pertains to source files, components, and modules. Good software design requires that we separate concepts at different levels and place them in different containers. Sometimes these containers are base classes or derivatives and sometimes they are source files, modules, or components. Whatever the case may be, the separation needs to be complete. We don’t want lower and higher level concepts mixed together.\nThe point is that you cannot lie or fake your way out of misplaced abstraction. Isolating abstractions is one of the hardest things that software developers do, and there is no quick fix when you get it wrong."

	val cleanCodeG07BaseClassesDependingOnTheirDerivatives = createCleanCodeComment(
		"[G07] - Base Classes Depending on Their Derivatives",
		"The most common reason for partitioning concepts into base and derivative classes is so that the higher level base class concepts can be independent of the lower level derivative class concepts. Therefore, when we see base classes mentioning the names of their derivatives, we suspect a problem. In general, base classes should know nothing about their derivatives.\nThere are exceptions to this rule, of course. Sometimes the number of derivatives is strictly fixed, and the base class has code that selects between the derivatives. We see this a lot in finite state machine implementations. However, in that case the derivatives and base class are strongly coupled and always deploy together in the same jar file. In the general case we want to be able to deploy derivatives and bases in different jar files.\nDeploying derivatives and bases in different jar files and making sure the base jar files know nothing about the contents of the derivative jar files allows us to deploy our systems in discrete and independent components. When such components are modified, they can be redeployed without having to redeploy the base components. This means that the impact of change is greatly lessened, and maintaining systems in the field is made much simpler."

A well-defined interface does not offer very many functions to depend upon, so coupling is low. A poorly defined interface provides lots of functions that you must call, so coupling is high.\nGood software developers learn to limit what they expose at the interfaces of their classes and modules. The fewer methods a class has, the better, The fewer variables a function knows about, the better. The fewer instance variables a class has, the better.\nHide your data. Hide your utility functions. Hide your constants and your temporaries. Don’t create classes with lots of methods or lots of instance variables. Don’t create lots of protected variables and functions for your subclasses.

You find it in little utility methods that are never called or switch/case conditions that never occur.\nThe problem with dead code is that after awhile it starts to smell. The older it is, the stronger and sourer the odor becomes. This is because dead code is not completely updated when designs change. It still compiles, but it does not follow newer conventions or rules. It was written at a time when the system was different. When you find dead code, do the right thing. Give it a decent burial.

Selector arguments are just a lazy way to avoid splitting a large function into several smaller functions.\nOf course, selectors needs not be boolean.

Perhaps it belongs in the Trigonometry class? Or maybe in the Circle class?\nThe principle of least surprise comes into play here. Code should be placed where a reader would naturally expect it to be. The PI constant should go where the trig functions are declared. The OVERTIME_RATE constant should be declared in the HourlyPayCalculator class.\nSometimes we get “clever” about where to put certain functionality. We’ll put it in a function that’s convenient for us, but not necessarily intuitive to the reader. For example, perhaps we need to print a report with the total of hours that an employee worked. We could sum up those hours in the code that prints the report, or we could try to keep a running total in the code that accepts time cards.\nOne way to make this decision is to look at the names of the functions. Let’s say that our report module has a function named getTotalHours. Let’s also say that the module that accepts time cards has a saveTimeCard function. Which of these functions, by it’s name, implies that it calculates the total? The answer should be obvious.\nClearly, there are sometimes performance reasons why the total should be calculated as time cards are accepted rather than when the report is printed. That’s fine, but the names of the functions ought to reflect this. For example, there should be a computeRunningTotalOfHour function in the timecard module."

All the data that max uses comes from its two arguments, and not from any “owning” object. More to the point, there is almost no chance that we’d want Math.max to be polymorphic.\nSometimes, however, we write static functions that should not be static.\nIn general you should prefer nonstatic methods to static methods. When in doubt, make the function nonstatic. If you really want a function to be static, make sure that there is no chance that you’ll want it to behave polymorphically."

You think you know the right algorithm for something, but then you wind up fiddling with it, prodding and poking at it, until you get it to “work”. How do you know it “works”? Because it passes the test cases you can think of.\nThere is nothing wrong with this approach. Indeed, often it is the only way to get a function to do what you think it should. However, it is not sufficient to leave the quotation marks around the work “work”.\nBefore you consider yourself to be done with a function, make sure you understand how it works. It is not good enough that it passes all the tests. You must know1 that the solution is correct.\nOften the best way to gain this knowledge and understanding is to refactor the function into something that is so clean and expressive that it is obvious how it works."

So this heuristic is here to remind us to consider polymorphism before using a switch.\nSecond, the cases where functions are more volatile than types are relatively rare.

If you specifically import a class, then that class must exist. But if you import a package with a wildcard, no particular classes need to exist. The import statement simply adds the package to the search path when hunting for names. So no true dependency is created by such imports, and they therefore serve to keep our modules less coupled.\nThere are times when the long list of specific imports can be useful. For example, if you are dealing with legacy code and you want to find out what classes you need to build mocks and stubs for, you can walk down the list of specific imports to find out the true qualified names of all those classes and then put the appropriate stubs in place. However, this use for specific imports is very rare. Furthermore, most modern IDEs will allow you to convert the wildcarded imports to a list of specific imports with a single command. So even in the legacy case it’s better to import wildcards.\nWildcard imports can sometimes cause name conflicts and ambiguities.

A programmer puts some constants in an interface and then gains access to those constants by inheriting that interface.\nThis is a hideous practice!

The meaning of enum cannot, because they belong to an enumeration that is named.\nWhat’s more, study the syntax for enums carefully. They can have methods and fields. This makes them more powerful tools that allow much more expression and flexibility than ints."

Remember that meanings tend to drift as software evolves, so frequently reevaluate the appropriateness of the names you choose.\nThis is not just a “feel-good” recommendation. Names in software are 90 percent of what make software readable. You need to take the time to choose them wisely and keep them relevant. Names are too important to treat carelessly.\nThe power of carefully chosen names is that they overload the structure of the code with description. That overloading sets the readers’ expectations about what the other functions in the module do."

Again, people are just too good at mixing levels of abstractions. Each time you make a pass over your code, you will likely find some variable that is named at too low a level. You should take the opportunity to change those names when you find them. Making code readable requires a dedication to continuous improvement."

For example, if you are using the Decorator pattern, you should use the word Decorator in the names of the decorating class. For example, AutoHangupModemDecorator might be the name of a class that decorate Modem with the ability to automatically hang up at the end of a session.\nPatterns are just one kind of standard. In Java, for example, functions that convert objects to String representations are often named toString. It is better to follow conventions like these than to invent your own.\nTeams will often invent their own standard system of names for a particular project. Eric Evans refers to this as ubiquitous language for the project.1 Your code should use the terms from this language extensively. In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about."
